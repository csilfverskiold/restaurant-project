# Restaurant Project

## Current state of project
This is a work in progress. The aim of the project is to create a landing page for a restaurant with user functionality to create a reservation. Included in the user functionality, the user will also be able to log in to view their created reservation details, as well as edit and delete their reservation. 

The project can be found in its current state: [Here](https://best-rest.herokuapp.com/)

## Planning
Before building, when planning this website I used the design tool Figma, to create a wireframe of the project. It allowed me to make a basic sketch of what I wanted the the website to look like, what features to include and where to place them. This proved to be very useful as I could base my decisions on the already sketched out wireframe when building the website.
