# Restaurant Project

## Current state of project
This is a work in progress. The aim of the project is to create a landing page for a restaurant with user functionality to create a reservation. Included in the user functionality, the user will also be able to log in to view their created reservation details, as well as edit and delete their reservation. 

## Planning
Before building, when planning this website I used the design tool Figma, to create a wireframe of the project. It allowed me to make a basic sketch of what I wanted the the website to look like, what features to include and where to place them. This proved to be very useful as I could base my decisions on the already sketched out wireframe when building the website.
